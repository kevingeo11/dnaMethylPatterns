1. Notebooks steric_superposition_1kx5.ipynb and steric_superposition_7v9j.ipynb contains the code for running the superposition approach. The notebook saves the clash information in the superposition folder along with the pymol session files, pdbs and pngs.
2. To visualize the steric plots run the plot_steric_clash.ipynb after running the superposition notebooks.
